# ShareableRealTimeStickies
Shareable Real-Time Stickynotes Webapp built for Firebase 3.xx, this was overhauled and reconstructed from stackhive into a tutorial used in SWE-432. It was aimed to demonstrate the capabilities of Firebase, and to help fellow classmates and my project team in practicing jQuery, Javascript and implementing both a back-end and front-end quickly. It was later integrated as a productivity component of our UnityDash web app for our final project.
