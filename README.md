# ShareableRealTimeStickies
Shareable Real-Time Stickynotes Webapp built in Firebase 3.xx, this was originally reconstructed as a tutorial in SWE-432.
It was aimed to demonstrate the capabilities of Firebase, and to help fellow classmate and my team in learning jQuery, Javascript and 
implementing both a back-end and front-end quickly. It was later integrated as a productivity component of our UnityOS web app for our 
final project.

See the site hosted on firebase at: https://rt-stickies.firebaseapp.com/
Warning - it may not be viewable on Chrome as some javascript components will be restricted and non-interactive. PLEASE VIEW ON FIREFOX.
